# EC2 Auto Scaling and Load Balancer Deployment

This repository contains infrastructure-as-code to deploy Amazon EC2 instances in a highly available architecture using Auto Scaling and a load balancer. It also includes an alarm configuration to scale up based on predefined metrics.

## Overview

This infrastructure setup is designed to achieve high availability and scalability for your application. It consists of the following components:

- **2 Public Subnets:** These subnets are configured to host the load balancer and allow public internet access. EC2 instances in the public subnets serve as front-end servers.

- **2 Private Subnets:** These subnets are used to deploy the main application servers. They do not have direct internet access and are accessible only through the load balancer.

- **Auto Scaling Group:** EC2 instances are managed by an Auto Scaling Group to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand.

- **Load Balancer:** The load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances in the public subnets, ensuring high availability and even distribution of workloads.

- **Scaling Alarm:** An alarm is configured to monitor specific metrics (e.g., CPU utilization or network traffic) and trigger the Auto Scaling Group to add more instances if thresholds are exceeded.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this infrastructure, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- An AWS account and AWS CLI configured with necessary credentials.
- Terraform installed on your local machine for infrastructure provisioning.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

   ```
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Modify the `variables.tf` and `main.tf` files to customize the deployment according to your requirements, such as instance types, key pairs, and other settings.

4. Initialize your Terraform workspace:

   ```
   terraform init
   ```

5. Deploy the infrastructure:

   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

6. Monitor the deployment and check for any errors in the Terraform output. If everything is successful, your infrastructure will be provisioned.

7. Access your application via the load balancer's DNS name.
